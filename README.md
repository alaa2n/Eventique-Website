## Event Management Website

### Overview
This repository contains the backend code for an event management website developed using ASP.NET Web Forms. The website serves as a platform for managing various aspects of events, including creation, registration, and administration. This website was developed by me and a collegiate team, and I worked as Back-End.

### Features
- **Event Creation**: Users can create new events by providing details such as event name, date, location, description, etc.
- **Event Registration**: Attendees can register for events by filling out a registration form with their personal information.
- **Admin Panel**: Administrators have access to an admin panel where they can view and manage events, registrations, and other related data.
- **User Authentication**: The website implements user authentication to secure access to certain functionalities, such as event creation and administration.
- **Database Integration**: Data is stored in a backend database (e.g., SQL Server) to persist event and user information.

### Technologies Used
- **ASP.NET Web Forms**: Used for building the frontend and backend of the website.
- **C#**: The primary programming language for backend development.
- **SQL Server**: Database management system for storing event and user data.
- **HTML/CSS**: Frontend markup and styling.
- **JavaScript**: Client-side scripting for interactive elements.
